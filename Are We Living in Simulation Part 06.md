## Recap

As in [[Are We Living in Simulation Part 01]], we have talked about **Quantum Computers**, **Facebook AI Chat**, and **Predictions of AI Robots** wherein [[Are We Living in Simulation Part 02]] we had a recap of **part 1** and also **The Matrix** movie, **Roswell UFO Incident**, wherein [[Are We Living in Simulation Part 03]] we discussed on [[Are We Living in Simulation Part 03#MKUltra]] performed by `US Central Intelligence Agency`, [[Are We Living in Simulation Part 03#Black Mirror: Bandersnatch]] movie where you can control **Stefan Butler** by given two choices which leads to a different path in the movies. In [[Are We Living in Simulation Part 04]] we talked about [[Are We Living in Simulation Part 04#UFO]] also we seen [[Are We Living in Simulation Part 04#Space Mysteries]] of `Restored Apollo 11` and also we saw the video a mysterious video where an unidentified spacecraft refuelling itself from the sun. In [[Are We Living in Simulation Part 05]] we talked about time travel where we seen some of the most known time travel and reference in the article about [[Are We Living in Simulation Part 05#Who was Sid Hurwich?]] which was about time machine which can `Freeze Time`, also we saw many mysteries of [[Are We Living in Simulation Part 05#Mike Tyson Match]], [[Are We Living in Simulation Part 05#Charlie Chaplin Moive]], [[Are We Living in Simulation Part 05#London Bridge Opening]], [[Are We Living in Simulation Part 05#A man from 2256]], [[Are We Living in Simulation Part 05#Swiss ring watch]], [[Are We Living in Simulation Part 05#1500 years old mummy wearing Adidas sneaker shoe]], [[Are We Living in Simulation Part 05#17th century astronaut]], [[Are We Living in Simulation Part 05#The man from Taured]]
, [[Are We Living in Simulation Part 05#John Titor]] well if the time travel is possible then it would be much more terrifying then we thought because they can go back to time and change the future or can destroy the future but there are many rules of travelling back or forward in time.

It is one of the most mysterious and elaborate puzzles available today for people worldwide. It is a puzzle where you need to have a good deal of technical knowledge, an understanding of number theory, including philosophy, classical music, knowledge of artist references, technological references, Mayan numerology, mathematics, cyberpunk literature, and the life cycles of cicadas. As per some speculations, Cicada 3301 is well-funded and large, considering that it has the deep knowledge to create such complex puzzles and at the same time, capable of supporting the existence of clues in a large number of locations, all far from one another.

In the year 2012, it was started, and then soon after one year, it again started for the people to solve the puzzles.

![r/A858DE45F56D9BC9](https://www.mistrysiddh.com/images/posts/r-A858DE45F56D9BC9.png)

 It all started back in 2011 when a Reddit account began posting an indecipherable sequence of numbers and letters to a new subreddit, r/A858DE45F56D9BC9, or [r/A858](http://www.reddit.com/r/A858DE45F56D9BC9) for short. After languishing in Internet obscurity for nearly a year, another Reddit user requested more information, asking: "Do these seemingly random strings of numbers ... correlate to something; is there some big joke I’m missing out on?" There was no reply, but enough people began to wonder the same thing themselves, and soon a sister subreddit, r/Solving_A858, was born. It consisted of "a dedicated group of computer science students, amateur cryptographers, and motivated enthusiasts" working together to crack the code, if indeed that's what it was, reports the Daily Dot. At first, the creator kept the subreddit private, with only those proving themselves worthy allowed in, but it eventually opened to the public.

There was no reply, but enough people began to wonder the same thing themselves, and soon a sister subreddit, [r/Solving_A858](https://www.reddit.com/r/Solving_A858/), was born.

At first, the creator kept the subreddit private, with only those proving themselves worthy allowed in, but it eventually opened to the public.

 Today only a few of the thousands of r/A858 posts have been decoded, but they tend to be cryptic—such as an excerpt from the book Actions and Passions by Max Lerner and the ASCII image of Stonehenge, reported Bustle last year. The subreddit creator was pretty much silent until August 2015 when an account appeared in the sister "solving" subreddit that (after appropriate code-breaking, of course) allowed users to ask questions. Still, any answers were themselves cryptic, such as: "We cannot disclose the purpose. A858 will end when the purpose is disclosed or discovered." Then on March 29, after having been private for some time (it switches between private and public regularly), r/A858 suddenly read: "The A858 Project Has Concluded. You may unsubscribe." Many still think the project isn't over. "I only hope A858 has a purpose," one user writes. "I don’t particularly care if it is a good one."

## India

India has been called the land of mysteries since time immemorial, whether for its various enigmatic natural phenomena or eccentricities associated with its religions and culture. And while science has worked hard to debunk and find a logical reason behind every riddle, there remain some that give rationalists a run for their money. Here are some of modern India’s most puzzling aspects that are bound to make your eyes pop!

### Kodinhi – Kerala’s village of twins
![Twin Town](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dC3fXAKSqsU/U5l3FHR6pfI/AAAAAAAABco/WbtxNtA_eLk/s1600/Kodinhi2.jpg)

By any metric, conceiving twins and triplets is a rare natural occurrence around the world. In fact, on average only 16 out of 1,000 successful pregnancies in the world result in twins and this average is even lower in India at just 9. However, this ratio is heavily skewed in the sleepy hamlet of Kodinhi in Kerala, which has a record 400 pairs of twins in a population of just over 2,000 families! Geneticists and scientists have long tried to explain this rare phenomenon but are only now making some headway. While experts have pointed to genetics as an obvious factor, what’s even more mysterious is that irrespective of religion, lineage or their original heritage, all families living in the village have conceived more than the average pairs of twins over the last few generations, and the number is consistently growing.

### Tanjore’s Brihadeeswara Temple
![Tanjore’s Brihadeeswara Temple](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jXTo2ZBydmk/WKX35fAuIoI/AAAAAAAAFRU/CHTrCTtdOlAIfaE2O0UY0S6WiaAReVQJwCLcB/s1600/Brihadeeswarar_Temple_Full_View.jpg)

The ‘Big Temple’ in Thanjavur is renowned across the world as an architectural marvel and is one of India’s 36 World Heritage Sites. While there are many imposing and majestic temples in Tamil Nadu, what makes this temple particularly interesting is its architectural mysteries that still confound many. The granite structure is popular for having one of the tallest gopurams in India and at the apex lies an 81-tonne monolithic Shikhara mounted at a height of 66 meters. While architecture and science have advanced over centuries to create much greater marvels, taken in the context of its era of construction, dating back more than 1,000 years, this aspect of the temple still baffles experts. Questions about how the heavy and huge Shikhara was mounted at such a height and how such massive amounts of granite were carried to the site with no recorded quarries in the vicinity are still unanswered. By some accounts, the tower is constructed in such a way that it does not cast a shadow at noon on any day of the year as well!

### Prahlad Jani – India’s fasting fakir!
![Prahlad Jani – India’s fasting fakir!](https://www.guioteca.com/cultura-india/files/2014/01/Prahlad-Jani.jpg)

India is a land of eccentric saints and sadhus, but none of these gurus has raised worldwide interest and flummoxed experts as much as Prahlad Jani, the sadhu who claims to have fasted without food or water for over 40 years. His claims had long been taken with a pinch of salt by scientists and experts and outright dismissed by rationalists. However, in 2010, Jani was part of an extensive study by a team of 35 Indian experts from the Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Science, which lasted over 15 days. While the study was shrouded in mystery with the government deciding not to divulge any details, it was widely publicised that the guru, also known as Mataji, was in good health despite not eating or drinking water and being in isolation for more than ten days. What’s more, it was further claimed that he did not urinate or excrete during the duration of the tests. While the veracity of this account is still an open question, it certainly has raised interest among the world’s leading experts.

### Kirti Stambha – the Iron Pillar of Delhi
![Kirti Stambha – the Iron Pillar of Delhi](https://i1.wp.com/www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Iron_pillar_delhi.jpg)

While the concept of rust-resistant iron only became prominent during the industrial revolution in western civilization, there stands an iron pillar in Delhi that predates such known material technology by nearly a millennium! The Kirti Stambha or victory pillar of Delhi is a six-tonne structure that is constructed out of iron sometime in the 5th century and has stood the test of time without succumbing to rust. The science of this pillar has baffled scientists, primarily for the fact that such advanced technology for rust resistance was thought to be unknown elsewhere in the world at the time.

### What is MKUltra?

![Declassified MKULTRA](/images/posts/DeclassifiedMKULTRA.jpg)
> According to Wikipedia

`Project MKUltra (or MK-Ultra)` also known as `CIA mind control Program`, is the code name given to a program of experiments on human subjects that were designed and undertaken by the `US Central Intelligence Agency`, some of which were illegal. Experiments on humans were intended to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations in order to be used in interrogation in order to weaken the individual and force confessions through mind control. The project was organized through the `Office of Scientific Intelligence` of the CIA and coordinated with the `United State Army Biological Warfare Laboratories`. Other code name for the drug related experiments were `Project Bluebird` and `Project Artichoke`.



The operation was officially sanctioned in 1953, reduced in scope in 1964 and further curtailed in 1967. it was officially halted in 1973. The program also engaged in illegal activities, including the used of US and Canadian citizens as its unwitting test subjects, which led to controversy regarding it legitimacy. MKUltra used numerous methods to manipulate its subjects' mental states and brain functions. Techniques included the covert administration of high doses of [psychoactive drug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug) (especially [LSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD)) and other chemicals, electroshocks, hypnosis, sensory, deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as other forms of torture.



The scope of Project MKUltra was broad, with research undertaken at more then 80 institutions, including colleges and universities hospitals, prisons, and pharmaceutical companies. The CIA operated using front organizations, although sometimes top of officials at these institutions were aware of the CIA's involvement.



Project MKUltra was first brought to public attention in 1975 by the `Church Committee` of the `United States Congress` and `Gerald Ford's United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States` (also known as the Rockefeller Commission).



Investigative effects were hampered by CIA Director `Richard Helms` order that all MKUltra files by `destroyed in 1973` the Church Committee and `Rockefeller Commission` investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the relatively small number of documents that survived Helms's destruction order. In 1997, a `Freedom of Information Act` requested uncovered a cache of `20,000 documents` related to project MKUltra which led to senate hearings later that year. Some surviving information regarding MKUltra was declassified in `July 2001`. In `December 2018`, declassified documents included a letter to an unidentified doctor discussing work on six dogs made to run, turn and stop via remote control and brain implants. Thanks to [TheBlackVault](https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/cia-mkultra-collection/) has the owner had `FOIA request` for all the documents pertaining to MKULTRA and related projects back in the late 1990s.

### What is Black Mirror: Bandersnatch?

<sup>Wikipidia</sup> Black Mirror: Bandersnatch is a interactive film in the science fiction anathology of serise `Black Mirror`. It was been written by serise creator `Charlie Brooker` and directed by `David Slade`. Netflix did not conirm the interactive nature of Bandersnatch until its release, though there was much media speculation. 

In this movie viewers make decisions for the main character, the young programmer `Stefan Butler`, who is adapting a fantasy gamebook into video game in 1984. In this game you have to select choice's to move forward every path has option to choice and your selection will decide you future action similar to that this movie has the same interface in `Netflix` you have to also select your action what our programmer `Stefan Butler` will do this will take you next stage there are multiple ending

![Choice Bandersnatch](/images/posts/Choice-Bandersnatch.jpg)

As you can see in the above picture you can see that you have to make choice whether to `THROW TEA OVER COMPUTER` or `SHOUT AT DAD` according to that Stefan Butler does the action. There are multiple option in the movie where you will be confused and also some option will take you backward in the movie for different ending. At a point of movie with selecting the same option will take you to a scene when `Colin` explain Stefan the concept of `PAC-man` where the `PAC` word belong to `Program Access and Control`

This also reference to [Matrix](https://mistrysiddh.tk/posts/are-we-living-in-simulation-part-2/) at [1:15s](https://youtu.be/D3qxWbQ8qek?t=75) in the video Colin speak of code `IT'S ALL CODE IF YOU LISTEN CLOSELY YOU CAN HEAR THE NUMBER'S` this is also reference to Matrix where in first part at the ending of the movie where Neo dies and wake up form dead see's the Matrix's as code flowing everywhere around him.

Also not that even in the movie at some post by selecting specific options you may lead to this scene which I never expected to see it in the movie it also included in the movie several time as 21<sup>th</sup> century entertainment services.

In this scenario Stefan tries to open window and the bell rung's of the cut scene where it shows the set of filming this scene the fight between Therapist and Stefan. There are many options in the movie which will lead you the scenes where Netflix is been introduced in the movie it has multiple endings as well as multiple Easter eggs the movie also there are some scenes which are not able to found out yet also there are soo many chipper in the movie say for example sound in of the tape Bandersnatch by Stefan butler etc.





If you know the Easter eggs of this movie and also some real live incident which believes you that the world which we are living in is just a simulation of the real world where we are just a test subject then let me know and I had found something for you will will make you more interesting to see.
